# Capstone Project
## Concentration


Concentration is an card matching game played in the browser.
My initial intentetion was to create a leaderboard, but I ended up enjoying the simplicity of the classic time waster game in its purity.

Clone, go live and try it out!

To supplement this, I also include in my Capstone a project that demonstrates REST API with CRUD functionality.
The httpclient repo on my github page can be cloned and run locally with go live or similar. 
It is set to localhost:5501 by default.

Similarly, the httpserver repo, when cloned, can be run with 'npm start'.
This is set to localhost:3000.
